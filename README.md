# IDS

Code and data for the case study in:

KÃ©ry M, Royle JA, Hallman T, Robinson WD, Strebel N, Kellner KF (2024). Integrated distance sampling models for simple point counts. Ecology. 

The version of `unmarked` with the `IDS()` function used in the analyses below should be on CRAN sometime in mid-2024, but in the meantime a copy can be found in this repository, or [here](https://github.com/rbchan/unmarked).

Until it's available on CRAN, this version of `unmarked` can be installed from the source package.
This requires [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) on Windows, or [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) on Mac.

```r
depends <- tools::package_dependencies('unmarked')[[1]]
depends <- depends[! depends %in% c("graphics", "methods", "parallel", "stats", "utils")]
install.packages(depends)
install.packages("unmarked_1.4.1.9001.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source")
```

or

```r
remotes::install_github("rbchan/unmarked")
```
