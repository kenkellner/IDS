# IDS

Code and data for the case study in:

KÃ©ry M, Royle JA, Hallman T, Robinson WD, Strebel N, Kellner KF (2024). Integrated distance sampling models for simple point counts. Ecology. 

The version of `unmarked` with the `IDS()` function used in the analyses below should be on CRAN sometime in mid-2024, but in the meantime can be found [here](https://github.com/rbchan/unmarked).

Until it's available on CRAN, this version of `unmarked` can be downloaded/installed with this code:

```r
remotes::install_github("rbchan/unmarked")
```
